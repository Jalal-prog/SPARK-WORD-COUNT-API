// After starting the SPARK SHELL for SCALA.
// Below is the API for word count in SCALA-SPARK through loading a data file from local path and saving into HDFS path.

scala>  //cutting off 'scala>' for the below codes for easy copy.

       .map(word => (word, 1))

       wordCounts.saveAsTextFile(“HDFS-path”)   // untill this the code is executed

// Similarly we can change the local path to HDFS path and vice versa, also use the AMAZON s3 path.
